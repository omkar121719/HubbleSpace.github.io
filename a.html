            <p class="text-m">Named in honor of the trailblazing astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope is
                a large, space-based observatory, which has revolutionized astronomy since its launch and deployment by
                the space shuttle Discovery in 1990. Far above rain clouds, light pollution, and atmospheric
                distortions, Hubble has a crystal-clear view of the universe. Scientists have used Hubble to observe
                some of the most distant stars and galaxies yet seen, as well as the planets in our solar system.</p>
            <p class="text-m">Hubble’s capabilities have grown immensely in its over 30 years of operation. This is
                because new, cutting-edge scientific instruments have been added to the telescope over the course of
                five astronaut servicing missions. By replacing and upgrading aging parts, these servicing missions have
                greatly extended the telescope’s lifetime.</p>
            <p class="text-m">Telescopes have a particular range of light that they can detect. Hubble’s domain extends
                from the ultraviolet through the visible (which our eyes see) and into the near-infrared. This range has
                allowed Hubble to deliver stunning images of stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects that have
                inspired people around the world and changed our understanding of the universe.</p>
            <p class="text-m">Hubble has made more than 1.5 million observations over the course of its lifetime. Over
                19,000 peer-reviewed science papers have been published on its discoveries, and every current astronomy
                textbook includes contributions from the observatory. The telescope has tracked interstellar objects as
                they soared through our solar system, watched a comet collide with Jupiter, and discovered moons around
                Pluto. It has found dusty disks and stellar nurseries throughout the Milky Way that may one day become
                fully fledged planetary systems and studied the atmospheres of planets that orbit other stars. Hubble
                has peered back into our universe’s distant past, to locations more than 13.4 billion light-years from
                Earth, capturing galaxies merging, probing the supermassive black holes that lurk in their depths, and
                helping us better understand the history of the expanding universe.</p>
            <p class="text-m">In its over 30 years of operation, Hubble has made observations that have captured
                humanity’s imaginations and deepened our knowledge of the cosmos. It will continue to do so for years to
                come.</p>
