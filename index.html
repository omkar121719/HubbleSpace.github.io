            <h3> CELEBRATING 30 YEARS </h3>
            <p>NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope celebrated 30 years of science discoveries that have revolutionizned
                nearly all areas of current
                astronomical research, from planetary science to cosmology, and its countless pictures are unmistakably
                out of this world.</p>
            <p>On April 24, 1990, the space shuttle Discovery lifted off from Earth with its precious cargo, the Hubble
                Space Telescope. The next day, astronauts released the telescope into space to begin its journey of
                discovery. No one could have predicted what wonders Hubble would see in the 30 years that followed. From
                our own cosmic backyard to the far reaches of the universe, Hubble showed us properties of space and
                time that for most of human history could only be imagined.</p>
            <p>Today, Hubble continues to churn out groundbreaking science, revealing new views of cosmic wonders and
                helping to answer even more of astronomy’s major questions. In the future, it will partner with NASA’s
                next great observatories, the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope,
                formerly known as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), to provide complementary science.

                    <h2>Proposal For Hubble</h2>
                    <p>In 1923, Hermann Oberth—considered a father of modern rocketry, along with Robert H. Goddard and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky—published Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen ("The Rocket into Planetary Space"), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket.</p>
                    <p>The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946, to astronomer Lyman Spitzer's paper entitled "Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory". In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes. First, the angular resolution (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by diffraction, rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as seeing.</p>
                    <p>Also crucial was the work of Nancy Grace Roman, the "Mother of Hubble". Well before it became an official NASA project, she gave public lectures touting the scientific value of the telescope. After it was approved, she became the program scientist, setting up the steering committee in charge of making astronomer needs feasible to implement and writing testimony to Congress throughout the 1970s to advocate continued funding of the telescope. Her work as project scientist helped set the standards for NASA's operation of large scientific projects.</p>

                    <h2>What has Hubble Found?</h2>
                    <p>Hubble's success is in no small part due to its position high above the atmosphere, removing many effects that hamper ground-based observers. In fact, ultraviolet astronomy is all but impossible to complete from the ground due to the presence of gases like ozone that block ultraviolet light in the upper atmosphere. Thanks to this and the lack of the turbulent air currents that make stars look like they are twinkling, Hubble is able to take some of the sharpest and deepest images of our Universe.</p>
                    <p>When Hubble shows us images in space, the view it gives us is always of how objects looked some time in the past. This is because light takes time to travel the long distances from the objects it came from. Even with relatively local objects the delay can be impressive, with our nearest neighbouring galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy, being viewed as it was almost 2.5 million years ago. This means telescopes like Hubble act like time machines, enabling us to study the history of our Universe.</p>
                    <p>When Hubble was first launched, a mistake with its mirror caused a large blurring effect that severely hampered its ability to complete ground breaking astronomy. The first servicing mission to Hubble had astronauts on the Endeavour space shuttle fix a flaw in Hubble’s mirror, bringing its optics to the stunning level of detail we see today.</p>

                    <h2>Building Of Hubble</h2>
                    <p>The Earth's atmosphere is the bane of astronomers. The idea of sending a telescope into space to avoid it was first proposed long before the first satellites were launched, long before anyone even dreamt of sending astronauts to space, German rocket scientist Herman Oberth was a pioneering thinker of his time and suggested a space bound telescope as early as 1923 in his book "Die Rakete zu den Planeträumen". A space telescope avoids frustrating problems such as cloudy and misty observing nights, the twinkling of stars even on clear nights and absorption of the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the spectrum.</p>
                    <p>It took many years before technology caught up with Oberth's idea. The American Lyman Spitzer proposed a more realistic plan for a space telescope in 1946 and lobbied for his idea for almost 30 years. In the 1970s NASA and the European Space Agency took up the idea and proposed a 3 metre space telescope. Funding began to flow in 1977 and it was decided to name the telescope after Edwin Powell Hubble who had discovered the expansion of the Universe in the 1920s. Although the Hubble Space Telescope was down-sized to 2.4 metres the project started to attract significant attention from astronomers.</p>
                    <p>The precision-ground mirror was finished in 1981 and the assembly of the entire spacecraft was completed in 1985. The plan called for a launch on NASA's Space Shuttle in 1986, but just months before, the scheduled launch the Challenger disaster caused a year long delay of the entire Shuttle programme.</p>

                    <h2>Future Of Hubble</h2>
                    <p>In its most recent review of Hubble operations, NASA announced that it would support the observatory through June 2026. In fact, current estimates suggest the observatory can stay in a high-enough orbit for operations to continue until the mid-2030s and beyond; its solar arrays and batteries are also in great shape.</p>
                    <p>The limiting factor comes down to the gyros that the space telescope uses to turn and lock onto targets. While almost all the observatory's systems are redundant, meaning there's still a back-up available if one piece fails, the gyros are one of the few exceptions. Hubble launched with six, but three have failed.</p>
                    <p>"The telescope is currently operating with three gyros and no spares," Andreoli says. However, while it takes three gyros to enable efficient operations, observations are still possible, albeit less efficient, with only one gyro.</p>
                    <p>An entire generation of astronomers have come of age with Hubble in space, and it remains a vital component in the toolbox of modern astronomers. Expect more great science to come from this venerable space telescope.</p>
