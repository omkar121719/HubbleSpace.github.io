            <p class="text-m">Behind Hubble's captivating images and groundbreaking science is a team of people who
                control the telescope, ensure its health and safety, and innovate ways to keep it at top performance
                more than three decades after its launch. This group of engineers, scientists, and operators at NASA's
                Goddard Space Flight Center work together to monitor Hubble as it travels around Earth, point the
                telescope at cosmic targets, and solve any problems that arise. They perform their work in specialized
                facilities that provide the tools and equipment needed to operate this great observatory and continue
                its legacy of success.</p>

                <h2>December 2-13, 1993</h2>
                <h2>Space Shuttle: Endeavour</h2>
                <p>Crew: Commander Richard O. Covey, Pilot Kenneth D. Bowersox, Payload Commander F. Story Musgrave, and Mission Specialists Kathryn C. Thornton, Claude Nicollier, Jeffrey A. Hoffman and Tom Akers</p>
                <p>As the first in a series of planned visits to the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, this mission,s most important objective was to install two devices to fix Hubble's vision problem. Because Hubble's primary mirror was incorrectly shaped, the telescope could not focus all the light from an object to a single sharp point. Instead, it saw a fuzzy halo around objects it observed.</p>
                <p>Once astronauts from the space shuttle Endeavour caught up with the orbiting telescope, they hauled it into the shuttle's cargo bay and spent five days tuning it up. They installed two new devices — the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) and the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR). Both WFPC2 and the COSTAR apparatus were designed to compensate for the primary mirror's incorrect shape.</p>
                <h2>Mission Highlights</h2>
                <p>1.COSTAR, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement installed, replacing High Speed Photometer (HSP)</p>
                <p>2.Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) replaced Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC)</p>

                <h2>February 11-21, 1997</h2>
                <h2>Space Shuttle: Discovery</h2>
                <p>Crew: Commander Kenneth D. Bowersox, Pilot Scott J. Horowitz, Payload Commander Mark C. Lee, Mission Specialists Steven A.Hawley, Gregory J. Harbaugh, Steven L. Smith and Joseph R. Tanner</p>
                <p>Hubble’s first generation cameras gave us remarkable views of very distant galaxies. However, the light from the most distant galaxies is shifted to infrared wavelengths by the expanding universe. To see these galaxies, Hubble needed to be fitted with an instrument that could observe infrared light.</p>
                <p>During a 10-day mission, seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery installed two technologically advanced instruments. The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) would be able to observe the universe in the infrared wavelengths. The second instrument — the versatile Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) — would be used to take detailed pictures of celestial objects and hunt for black holes.</p>
                <p>The new instruments replaced the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph and the Faint Object Spectrograph.</p>
                <h2>Mission Highlights</h2>
                <p>1.Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) replaced Faint Object Spectrometer (FOS)</p>
                <p>2.Near Infrared Camera/Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) replaced Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS)</p>

                <p>4.Addition of an Optical Control Electronics Enhancement Kit (OCE-EK)</p>
                <p>5.Replacement of #1 Engineering Science Tape Recorder (ESTR) with digital Solid State Recorder (SSR) and replacement of #2 ESTR with a spare ESTR unit</p>
                <p>6.Replacement of Data Interface Unit (DIU) #2 with modified and upgraded spare unit</p>

                <h2>December 19-27, 1999</h2>
                <h2>Space Shuttle: Discovery</h2>
                <p>Crew: Commander Curtis L. Brown, Pilot Scott J. Kelly, Payload Commander Steven L. Smith, Mission Specialists C. Michael Foale, John M. Grunsfield, Claude Nicollier and Jean-Francois Clervoy</p>
                <p>NASA decided to split the Servicing Mission 3 (SM3) into two parts, SM3A and SM3B, after the third of Hubble’s six gyroscopes failed. (At that time, Hubble needed three gyroscopes to observe a celestial target.) The second part of the mission, SM3B, took place March 1–12, 2002.</p>
                <p>On November 13, 1999, the Hubble Space Telescope was placed into safe mode after the failure of a fourth gyroscope. In safe mode Hubble could not observe targets, but its safety was preserved. This protective mode allows ground control of the telescope, but with only two gyros working, Hubble cannot be aimed with the precision necessary for scientific observations of the sky. Controllers closed the aperture door to protect the optics and aligned the spacecraft to ensure that Hubble’s solar panels would receive adequate power from the Sun.</p>
                <p>In the first of the two-part mission, the most pressing task was the replacement of the gyroscopes. The crew, two of whom were Hubble repair veterans, replaced all six gyroscopes — as well as one of Hubble’s three Fine Guidance Sensors, which allow fine pointing and keep Hubble stable during observations, and a transmitter.</p>
                <h2>Mission Highlights</h2>
                <p>1.Replacement of all three Rate Sensing Units (RSUs), each of which contains two gyroscopes</p>
                <p>2.Installation of new computer, 20 times faster with six times more memory than its predecessor</p>
                <p>3.Replacement of original reel-to-reel data recorder with digital Solid State Recorder (SSR) which is faster, more reliable and can store 10 times as much data</p>
                <p>4.Replacement of #2 of 3 Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) with refurbished unit</p>
                <p>5.Installation of Shell/Shield Replacement Fabric (SSRF) over the original Multi-Layer Insulation on Hubble’s forward shell and light shield to add thermal protection</p>

                <h2>March 1-12, 2002</h2>
                <h2>Space Shuttle: Columbia</h2>
                <p>Crew: Commander Scott D. Altman, Pilot Duane G. Carey, Payload Commander John M. Grunsfeld, Mission Specialists Nancy J. Currie, James H. Newman, Richard M. Linnehan and Michael J. Massimino</p>
                <p>Servicing Mission 3B was the fourth visit to Hubble. NASA split the original Servicing Mission 3 into two parts and conducted the first part — Servicing Mission 3A — in December 1999.</p>
                <p>The astronauts’ principal task was to install a new science instrument called the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The first new instrument to be installed in Hubble since 1997, ACS brought the nearly 12-year-old telescope into the 21st century. With its wide field of view, sharp image quality, and enhanced sensitivity, ACS doubled Hubble's field of view and collects data 10 times faster than the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), the telescope's earlier surveying instrument.</p>
                <p>Spacewalking astronauts replaced the large, flexible, eight-year-old Solar Array Panels with smaller, rigid ones that produce 30 percent more power. They also replaced the outdated Power Control Unit, which distributes electricity from the solar arrays and batteries to other parts of the telescope. Replacing the original unit, which has been on the job for nearly 12 years, required the telescope to be completely powered down for the first time since its launch in 1990.</p>
                <h2>Mission Highlights</h2>
                <p>1.Installation of Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), replacing the Faint Object Camera (FOC)</p>
                <p>2.Installation of NICMOS Cooling System (NCS) comprised of two components, the NICMOS Cryogenic Cooler (NCC) and the NCS radiator, to revive the NICMOS instrument</p>
                <p>3.Replace Solar Arrays 2 (SA2) with smaller, more efficient Solar Arrays 3 (SA3)</p>
                <p>4.Replace #1 of four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA), part of Hubble’s pointing control system, with a refurbished unit</p>
                <p>5.Replace Power Control Unit (PCU) to take full advantage of additional power generated by the new solar arrays</p>
                <p>6.Fit New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) on Bays 1, 9 and 10</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>May 11-24, 2009</h2>
                <h2>Space Shuttle: Atlantis</h2>
                <p>Crew: Commander Scott D. Altman, Pilot Gregory C. Johnson, Payload Commander John M. Grunsfeld, Mission Specialists Michael J. Massimino, Andrew J. Feustel, Michael T. Good and K. Megan McArthur</p>
                <p>Servicing Mission 4 (SM4) was the culmination of a long effort to provide the telescope with one, final servicing mission. Originally scheduled for 2004, SM4 was postponed and then cancelled after the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Following the successful recovery of the shuttle program and a re-examination of SM4 risks, NASA approved another mission. This was perhaps Hubble’s most challenging and intense servicing mission, with a multitude of tasks to be completed over the course of five spacewalks.</p>
                <p>WFC3 sees three different kinds of light: near-ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared, though not simultaneously. The camera’s resolution and field of view is much greater than that of previous instruments. Astronauts removed Hubble’s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to make room for WFC3.</p>
                <p>In late September 2008, only two weeks before the mission was to launch, a malfunction occurred in one of the systems that commands the science instruments and directs the flow of data within the telescope. The problem was fixed by switching to a backup system, but NASA was unwilling to leave the telescope without a spare. The mission was delayed until May while engineers and scientists tested and prepared an existing and nearly identical system. Astronauts were able to install the spare Science Instrument Command and Data Handling unit in addition to all previously scheduled tasks.</p>
                <h2>Mission Highlights</h2>
